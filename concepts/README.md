## What is scope?
In general, the concept of **[Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)** in computer programming pertains to the **accessibility** of variables and functions from a given point of the code. In other words, as we write a line of code, what variables and functions do we have access to? JavaScript scope is lexical, which means that it's determined by the physical structure of the code.  

If a line of code doesn’t have access to a variable/function, we could say that variable/function is “out of scope”.
