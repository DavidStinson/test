## About

Designed for learners ranging from beginner to advanced, this module takes students on an in-depth exploration of JavaScript scope‚Äî a foundational but often misunderstood aspect of coding. Students start with the basics of the scope chain, understanding how variables and functions interact in different layers of a program and advance to more nuanced topics like the 'var' keyword and limitations of global scope.

## Prerequisites

 - Control Flow in Javascript
 - Intro to Javascript Functions
